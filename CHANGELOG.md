# Changelog

## 2025-09-13

- Add support for the AGENTS.md standard across the repository.
  - New `AGENTS.md` at the root and `guided-agents/AGENTS.md` for nested guidance.
  - Updated `README.md` and `README_es.md` to explicitly state compatibility with providers that support AGENTS.md (e.g., Cursor, Aider, GitHub Copilotâ€™s coding agent, Zed, Google Gemini CLI, RooCode, Factory, Amp, Ona, Phoenix, VS Code project AI rules, Warp, Semgrep, Devin).
- No breaking changes. Existing guided flow and agents continue to work as before.
- Principle: lean, results-driven steps with strategic HITL (confirm before overwriting, backups with timestamp).
